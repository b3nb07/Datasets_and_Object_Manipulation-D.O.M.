## Datasets for Objects and Manipulation (D.O.M)

Welcome to your new program! Here's a quick guide to get started along with some tips and tricks to help you make the most of it.

---

### Introduction

Generating images of 3D objects can be tedious when working with large datasets. D.O.M. is here to simplify the process. This program is designed to help you efficiently generate datasets for your 3D objects. It aims to make dataset generation easier, while offering a dedicated tool for your needs.

### Installation Prerequisites
##### General Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have python installed - https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
1. Set up your workspace and navigate to it in VSCode or your chosen code editor of choice.
1. In terminal <code style="color:Gray">run pip install -r requirements.txt</code>

##### MacOS Prerequisites - (https://github.com/DLR-RM/BlenderProc/issues/768) 
Error Message - (Permission Error: Operation not permitted)
1. Open system settings and navigate to privacy & security
1. Navigate to full disk access and add new applications. 
1. Give terminal full disk access: Applications/Utilities/terminal
1. Give vs-code full disk access: Applications/VSCode
1. Ensure that both of these applications are selected for this to avoid the permission error.

### Getting Started

To run D.O.M., simply execute the `UI.py` file located in the `frontend` folder.

#### Steps:
1. Begin by loading a tutorial object or uploading an object.
   
   ![Import](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0347dd6-a998-4835-8b02-1d7f74b0b523)
   
2. When uploading a custom object, you can choose to upload an individual file or a folder. (Uploaded items will share their file name within the software.)
   
   ![ImportObject](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9be4bc43-706f-49d1-bba7-b8a18c836b0a)

3. Once an object is uploaded, the viewport will automatically update. Any changes you make to elements in the scene will trigger automatic updates in the viewport.

### Object Bar

When an object is uploaded, the **ObjectBar** will append an element. This allows you to specify whether particular objects in the scene should be grounded or not.

### Object Tab

The **ObjectTab** enables users to change the starting elements for each object. Users can select the object via the combobox (highlighted in orange below).

### Render Tab

The **RenderTab** provides options to configure rendering settings:

- Specify the number of renders to generate (red).
- Define the change in degrees per axis of freedom (green).
- Begin rendering by pressing **Generate Renders** (blue).
- Use the unlimited render feature to generate renders continuously until manually stopped (orange).
